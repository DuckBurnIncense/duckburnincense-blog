# duckburnincense-blog

DuckBurnIncense 的 blog

https://blog.duckburnincense.com/

本站使用[Fuwari](https://github.com/saicaca/fuwari)主题, 由[Astro](https://astro.build)构建.

魔改了一点 Fuwari, 新增了 `license` 和 `pinned` Frontmatter.

## 📝 Frontmatter of Posts

```yaml

```

## 🧩 Markdown Extended Syntax

- Admonitions ([Preview and Usage](https://fuwari.vercel.app/posts/markdown-extended/#admonitions))
- GitHub repository cards ([Preview and Usage](https://fuwari.vercel.app/posts/markdown-extended/#github-repository-cards))
- Enhanced code blocks with Expressive Code ([Preview](https://fuwari.vercel.app/posts/expressive-code/) / [Docs](https://expressive-code.com/))
